A project to test the ability of Bluemix and Alchemy. 

The original code came from this site:

Build a blog app with Ruby on Rails and Bluemix
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-blograils-app/index.html

I'm a novice to rails and everything.
There's a lots of errors when I tried to push my own app to bluemix.
So I modify the sample code which can be pushed successfully.
If you know a thing or two about pushing rails project to bluemix, 
please contact me, thanks.
